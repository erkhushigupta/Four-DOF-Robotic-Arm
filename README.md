**Code**: Write or upload the Arduino code to control the servo motors and any sensors you may have added. The code will define the arm's movements and behaviour.

**WORKING:**
The working of a 4-Degree-Of-Freedom (4-DOF) robotic arm involves a combination of mechanical design, control algorithms, and actuators to achieve precise and controlled movements in a specific workspace. a 4-DOF robotic arm typically works:

**1. Mechanical Structure**: The robotic arm's mechanical structure consists of four joints, each providing one degree of freedom:

• Shoulder Joint (Joint 1): This joint allows the arm to rotate horizontally.

• Elbow Joint (Joint 2): The elbow joint enables vertical movement.

• Wrist Joint (Joint 3): This joint provides twisting or yawing motion.

• End Effector Joint (Joint 4): The final joint controls the rotation of the effect.

**2. Kinematics**: The kinematics of the robotic arm define the relationship between joint angles and the resulting position and orientation of the end effector. Forward kinematics equations calculate the end effector's position and orientation based on joint angles. Inverse kinematics equations determine the required joint angles to achieve a desired end effector position and orientation.

**3. Sensors**: Sensors such as encoders are integrated at each joint to measure the actual joint angles and positions. These sensors provide feedback to the control system, enabling accurate positioning and movement control.

**4. Control System**: The control system processes input from sensors and user commands to generate control signals for the actuators. It employs control algorithms, such as Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control, to regulate joint angles and achieve desired end effector positions.

**5. Trajectory Planning**: Trajectory planning involves generating a sequence of joint angles that allow the end effector to move smoothly along a desired path or reach specific positions and orientations. Trajectories can be predefined or calculated in real-time based on user input.

**6. Actuators**: Electric motors, servos, or other actuators are responsible for providing the necessary torque and movement to each joint. These actuators execute the control signals generated by the control system.

**7. Movement Execution**: When a movement command is given, the control system calculates the required joint angles using inverse kinematics. The control signals are sent to the actuators, which move the joints accordingly.

**8. Feedback Loop**: During movement, the sensors continuously provide feedback on joint angles and positions. The control system uses this feedback to adjust control signals and maintain accuracy.

**9. End Effector Actions**: Based on the orientation of the end effector, it can perform actions such as grasping, releasing, rotating, or applying tools to objects in its workspace.
